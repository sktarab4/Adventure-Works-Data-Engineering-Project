# adventure-works-azure-pipeline

This project showcases an end-to-end data pipeline built entirely on Azure. Data is ingested from external sources using the HTTP connector in Azure Data Factory, stored in Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2, and transformed using Azure Databricks. The transformed data is then queried through Azure Synapse Analytics, and the final insights are visualized in Power BI dashboards. This modular and scalable architecture follows the principles of a modern data lakehouse, enabling efficient data processing, analytics, and reporting.
